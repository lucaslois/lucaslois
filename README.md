## Hi there 👋, I'm Lucky.

I'm a software developer currently living on Argentina. I like to work mostly with web technologies such PHP and Javascript, but i can learn any other language that i need.

I like to learn new tecnologies, metodologies and best practices to develop better software.

- 💻 Now, **i am working at Braintly**, a Software Boutique based on Argentina where we make amazing software for diferent clients and startups.
- 📖 I am currently learning about architecture and better ways to organize the code.
- ⌨️ My principal tecnologies are PHP (using Laravel), Javascript (React & Vue), NodeJS (Typescript, Express, TypeORM, Sequelize). Although i have done some projects working as frontender, I prefer to work in the backend.
- 🔎 I have strongly knowledge in Object Oriented Programming, applying principles like Design Patterns, SOLID, Unit Testing.
- 🤓 I like theory. I love to discover the foundations behind the things so i try to read books, take courses, read a lot of articles and blog post, and see a lot of Youtube videos. (My last book read was "Clean Architecture" of Robert C. Martin).
- 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Currently i am learning english, sorry if you see a lot of errors writing this text 😅
