## Hi there 👋, I'm Lucky.

I'm a software developer currently living on Argentina 🇦🇷. I like to work mostly with web technologies such PHP and Javascript, but I can use any other language that i need.

I like to learn new tecnologies, methodologies and best practices to develop better software.

- 💻 Now, **I am working at Braintly**, a Software Boutique company based on Argentina where we make amazing software for diferent clients and startups.
- 📖 I am currently **learning about architecture** and better ways to organize the code.
- ⌨️ My principal tecnologies are **PHP (using Laravel), Javascript (React & Vue), NodeJS (Typescript, Express, TypeORM, Sequelize)**. Although I have done some projects working as frontender, I prefer to work in the backend.
- 📁 I've worked with Mysql and PostgresSQL, I want to research some about NoSQL like MongoDB but for now I haven't have the oportunity.
- 🔎 I have **strongly knowledge in Object Oriented Programming**, applying principles like Design Patterns, SOLID and Unit Testing.
- 🤓 **I like theory**. I love to discover the foundations behind the things so I try to read books, take courses, read a lot of articles and blog posts and see a lot of Youtube videos. (My last book read was "Clean Architecture" of Robert C. Martin).
- 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Currently **I am learning english**, sorry if you see a lot of errors wrote on this text 😅
- 🤪 **I like to build software ~~for stupid things~~ to solve problems**. Once i wanted to buy some sneakers and it was so expensive, so I programmed a web scrapper using Python to scan the page every day and send me an email when the script detects a discount. I saved 25% of money doing that 💸.
